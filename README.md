Hello this is devansh gupta and this is my final project under the 6 week IBM skillbuild intenship (under edunet foundation).
In this project I am using basic web devlopment languages (like HTML, CSS, Javascript) to make it simple and easy to understand by the user point of view.
I use javascript for stenography and html and css for structure building.
