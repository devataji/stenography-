🔒 **Introducing Stenganograpny: Hiding Messages in Plain Sight!**🔒  

We're excited to showcase our latest project—**Stenganograpny**, a web-based steganography tool that allows users to conceal secret messages within images! 🖼️🔏

✨ What it does:

Upload an image and type a message – the tool embeds it into the image’s pixel data using the least significant bit (LSB) technique.
Download the encoded image, which looks identical to the original but secretly carries your message.
Decode the image later to reveal the hidden text.

💡How It Works:  
✅ Upload an image 🎨  
✅ Enter a secret message ✉️  
✅ Encode the message within the image using **LSB steganography** 🧠  
✅ Download and share the encoded image 📤  
✅ Decode the hidden message with just a click! 🕵️‍♂️  

Our project leverages **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** to deliver an intuitive and secure way to embed and extract hidden messages. Whether it's for secure communication, watermarking, or just for fun—**Stenganograpny** makes steganography accessible to everyone!
