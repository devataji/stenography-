Hello this is devansh gupta and this is my final project under the 6 week IBM skillbuild intenship (under edunet foundation).
In this project I am using basic web development languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to make it simple and easy to understand by the user point of view.
I use JavaScript for stenography and html and CSS for structure building.
